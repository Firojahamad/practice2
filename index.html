    <h1>Cloud Computing Overview</h1>

    <p>Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet (the cloud) instead of owning and maintaining them on local devices or data centers.</p>

    <h2>Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <table>

            <th>Characteristic</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>On-Demand Self-Service</td>
            <td>Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Broad Network Access</td>
            <td>Services are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms by diverse client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Resource Pooling</td>
            <td>Providers' computing resources are pooled to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rapid Elasticity</td>
            <td>Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to quickly scale up or down based on demand.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Measured Service</td>
            <td>Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and the consumer.</td>
